Thank you for trying out this mod!
Please create an `Issue` if you have any problems with it. I've only tested it on Nauvis so far.

## Development & Release Process

This mod uses GitHub Actions for automated building and releasing:

1. To release a new version:
   - Update the version number in `all-music-everywhere/info.json`
   - Create and push a new tag (e.g., `git tag v0.0.2 && git push origin v0.0.2`)
   - The workflow will automatically build the mod and create a GitHub Release

2. Manual releases can also be triggered from the Actions tab in the GitHub repository.
